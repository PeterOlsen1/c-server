# C-Server

I am practicing my c skills here. Don't expect anything monumental. There's probably a lot of security vulnerabilities (oops!)

### To run:
Navigate to the top level directory and execute:
```
make run
```
This command boots up the server and starts accepting requests on localhost:3000

TODO:
* Make sure body parsing does not take any extra characters with it
* Send different file types (binary files?)
